obstacle_range: 2.5 #determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap. Means that the robot will only update its map with information about obstacles that are within 2.5 meters of the base.
raytrace_range: 3.0 # determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading. Setting it to 3.0 meters as we have above means that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to 3.0 meters away given a sensor reading
#footprint: [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ... [xn, yn]]
robot_radius: 0.065
inflation_radius: 0.15 #maximum distance from obstacles at which a cost should be incurred
